# QuickPass

Cross-platform and minimalistic password manager written in C++ and Qt5.

The application offers a simple user interface to allow users to insert, search and generate account credentials, including their passwords. The project serves as a starting point for more advanced password managers. Feel free to copy the code, modify it, and add more features as you see fit.
